          <img src="images/Aboutme1.jpg" alt="David B. Friedman">

          <p>David was born and raised in Tampa, FL. David has three sisters, Abigail, Emma and Noa who all, like him, started in theatre at a very young age. David grew up with the peacocks at Independent Day School: Corbett Campus (now Corbett Prep) where he was first bitten with the theater bug, playing Narrator #7 in Mrs. B's production of The Cool Cats Go Down the Nile (OFGC) ((Original First Grade Cast)). David went on to attend Howard W. Blake School of the Arts where, under the direction of Sean Ryan Paris and Seth Travaglino, he was seen in The Tempest, Parade, Bat Boy and many other productions. During his time at Blake, David was a proud member of Florida State Thespians Troupe 5742, where earned several superiors for his participation in multiple Individual Events, as well as having the honor of being District 9 District Representative performing at Opening Ceremonies in 2012, a scene from The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged). In addition to Theatre, David is a Trombonist , Pianist and an Eagle Scout (with Bronze, Gold and Silver Palms). </p>

          <p>David is a proud Penn Stater, graduating with a BFA in Musical Theatre and a Minor in History in 2019, under the Direction of John Simpkins. While at Penn State, David’s favorite shows include: Marvin in Falsettoland; Black Stache in Peter and the Starcatcher; Warden in Kiss of the Spiderwoman; Archibald in The Secret Garden (Dir. Susan H. Schulman), Judge Taylor in To Kill a Mockingbird (Dir. Susan H Schulman); and Jonah in Bad Jews. David was also lucky enough to participate in Penn State’s New Works initiative where he originated the role of  the loathsome yet ridiculous King Ambrose/ Ferryman in Kirsten Childs’ new musicalThe Lucky Boy. During his time at Penn State David also was a part of “The Halftime Show of the Century” with the Penn State Blue Band and the entire Penn State department of Musical Theatre, performing at the 2018 Football White Out game against Ohio State. </p>
